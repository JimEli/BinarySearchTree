# Binary Search Tree 
## Templated BST data structure using smart pointers

Includes basic demonstration of:
* adding nodes
* deleting nodes
* traversals (recursive and iterative)
* bfs, dfs (in, pre & post-order), searching
* node hegiht, balanced tree check and balancing O(n) via in-order insertion/removal to/from a vector.
* includes simple supporting implementations of static array-based stack and queue, vector, singly linked list, and STL-like container array wrapper.
