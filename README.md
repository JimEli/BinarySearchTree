# Binary Search Tree 
## Templated BST data structure using smart pointers

Includes basic demonstration of:
* adding nodes
* deleting nodes
* traversals (recursive and iterative)
* bfs, dfs (in, pre & post-order) searching
* includes simple supporting implementations of static array-based stack and queue, vector, singly linked list, and STL-like container array wrapper.
